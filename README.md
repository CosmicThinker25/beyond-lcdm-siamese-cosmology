This repository contains the full manuscript, figures, and numerical scripts supporting the paper:

**“Beyond ΛCDM: The CPT-Siamese Phase Mechanism as a Unified Solution to the Dark Energy, H₀ and σ₈ Tensions.”**

## 📌 Scientific Overview

This work introduces a **CPT-symmetric Siamese cosmology** in which **dark energy emerges dynamically from vacuum phase desynchronization**, rather than from a fundamental cosmological constant. A single phase-interference mechanism simultaneously addresses:

- The **H₀ tension**
- The **σ₈ structure growth tension**
- **Late-time cosmic acceleration anomalies**
- The apparent **breakdown of ΛCDM at low redshift**

The model predicts a **transient acceleration phase followed by asymptotic deceleration**, in qualitative agreement with recent observational trends.

## ✅ Included in This Repository

This repository explicitly includes:

- ✅ The **full paper (PDF)**
- ✅ The **Python script used to generate Figure 1**
- ✅ The **comparative H(z) vs. z plot** between ΛCDM and Siamese cosmology
- ✅ All material required to **numerically reproduce the central observational result**

Figure 1 corresponds to the **Hubble expansion comparison H(z)** between ΛCDM and CPT-Siamese cosmology.

## 📊 Additional Reproducibility Data (Figures 2 & 3)

The two additional diagnostic figures used in the paper:

- **Expansion Turnover:** H(z)/(1+z)
- **Deceleration Parameter:** q(z) vs Son & Lee (2025)

are fully reproduced in the companion reproducibility dataset hosted at:
